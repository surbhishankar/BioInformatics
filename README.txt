The .pdb files and the file containing the program should be placed in the same folder.
File name of the code is bioproject.py
I have used 1NVS.pdb for demo purpose. 

You can run this code using Secure Shell Client environment.

Go to the folder where the file is stored (usually in public_html).
	Run the below command
	$python bioproject.py
	
	The output will be as follows - 
	Please enter the filename (with .pdb extension):
	
	You should enter the complete file name aling with the extension as ".pdb". For example, 1NVS.pdb
	
The output of this will be stored in three different files named "outputtask1.pdb", "outputtask2.pdb" and "outputtask3.pdb" in the same folder.

You can open this file in Chimera software in order to see the structure formation.
